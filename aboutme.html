		<p>My childhood was scented with the nutty aroma of oil paint and the smell of freshly sharpened pencils. 
			Growing up, nothing amazed me more than the way my grandfather made his paintbrush dance freely on the canvas. 
			I would always take my tiny stool, a bag of crayons, and a piece of paper to copy whatever he was doing. 
			A gray-haired old man painting and a 7-year-old girl copying on the sideâ€”it was a sight to see. </p>

		<p>When I moved to the United States from China, my grandfather did not follow, but the passion for art he had planted in me followed me across the ocean.
		I continued to draw on my own and take art classes at high school. One of which is called Design & Visual Communication, 
		where I was exposed to a new field within the art spectrum: design. I instantly fell in love with the idea that art can be applied to the smallest aspects of everyday life,
		and make a difference in the world. I want to continue my artistic pursuit beyond paper and pencil in the field of design, 
		and create things that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but most importantly, serve the underrepresented community through creativity and empathy. </p>
