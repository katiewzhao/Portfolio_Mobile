	<main>
		<p>We surveyed and interviewed service dog handlers about their process of obtaining/training such companion(s), as well as how they get their service animal related concerns resolved. </p>		
		<p>We also researched about service animal basics, and the common questions asked about service animals + the ADA. This is done with the aim to better understand our audience and the degree of accessibility/availability of information regarding service animals. </p>
		<p>Our chatbot design aims to fill in the information accessibility gap by providing a safe space to connect with other service dog handlers while acting as a source for unbiased, correct information.</p>
		<h2>Common sources of misinformation in SD community</h2>
		<ul class="content">
			<li>Qualifying for a service dog</li>
			<li>Must have a “permanent” disability that could be helped by a service dog</li>
			<li>Must have a doctor’s note</li>
			<li>Certification</li>
			<li>There is no official certification required</li>
			<li>May optionally choose to get certified</li>
			<li>Training</li>
			<li>There is no official training required</li>
			<li>Handlers may owner-train, hire a trainer, attend group classes, or purchase a dog that is already trained</li>
		</ul> 
		<h2>Research main findings</h2>
		<ul class="content">
			<li>Most handlers owner-trained at least some of the time</li>
			<li>Difficult starting off</li>
			<li>Classes + trainers are expensive</li>
			<li>Misinformation is one of the biggest problems with existing resources</li>
			<li>Most handlers wished they had access to other trainers and more reliable information
			</li>
			<li>People still seek help when situations arise
			</li>
			<li>Every handler & SD’s situation is different; no one-size-fits-all
			</li>
			<li>“My first service dog was a disaster.”
			</li>
			<li>“I really wanted my dog to do well, when she doesn’t I get frustrated easily.”
			</li>
			<li>“Your dog is a partner, not just a tool.”
			</li>
			<li>“Service dog are a luxury”
			</li>
			<li>“ADA is too lenient and not understandable.”
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Concept</h2>
			<p>A forum to facilitate productive conversation between handlers and share news and a chatbot to help with common ADA questions and training resources.
			</p>
			<ul class="content">
				<li>Chatbot helps with decoding the ADA</li>
				<li>App gives encouraging advice; Chatbot encourages the handler when hitting roadblocks, give encouragement and solution</li>
				<li>Chatbot has the persona of a dog - handlers can choose breed & name according to their own dog; more forgiving because it is as if their SA is talking</li>
				<li>Chatbot is a database of every credible source (ServiceDogCentral.org) + is updated regularly, News page for recent SA-related info </li>
				<li>“Secret chat” area with polls, articles, etc. Chats with other handlers will stay completely anonymous; Online community for service animal handlers to post what their animal can do + other info;App provides a safe space to ask questions without feeling gatekept</li>
				<li>Chatbot that debunks SA myths; App highlights that official certification is not needed</li>
				<li>App is specialized to owner’s disability-- regarding news page & task training
				</li>
			</ul>
